# What is hikmah?
It means not being sallow in thinking.
It means different thing to different things to different people. If we translate it loosely it means "wisdom".

Allah said to prophet (PBUH) to call people to deen with wisdom.

Example: When telling your child to do something you can say it in a number of ways. But you can also say them in a way that they will still do that thing when your not there. That is calling people with wisdom.
